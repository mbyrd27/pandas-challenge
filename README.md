# Py Schools Homework

## Notable Observations

- In terms of Overall Passing Rate, Charter Schools performed significantly better than District Schools. Average math and reading scores were also both higher for Charter schools. All of the bottom five performing schools were District schools.

- Also in terms of Overall Passing Rate, medium and small schools performed significantly better than large schools (schools with over 2,000 students). Small and medium schools seemed to perform slightly better in math, but not significantly better in reading than large schools. 

- Across each grade level, there does not seem to be a significant difference in math or reading scores at each school. The greatest variation is apparent when comparing scores of students from each school itself.
